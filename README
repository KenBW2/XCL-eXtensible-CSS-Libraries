    CSS LIBRARIES
    Pre-built extensible CSS plugins for isolated use in any context to solve common CSS problems
    
    PURPOSE
    These CSS libraries are intended to consolidate CSS code that is
    commonly replicated all over the web into several modular plugins.
    They are intended to be generic in order to be used for any purpose,
    while also being extensible so that any functionality can be
    overridden using CSS's 'cascading' functionality.
    It has been modelled using some principles of Classes and Inheritance
    from Object Oriented Programming, with CSS classes being available
    for use as-is, or to be inherited and some properties to be overridden
    as required.
    
    INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
    The libraries should be included as @import instructions at the top of
    your CSS file. These should be seen as the libraries available in many OOP
    languages - they can be used as-is, or inherited and then extended
    by adding sub-classes. But they should be treated as read-only.
    
    If you require a change in functionality set the class of the rule
    and set the properties you would like to override. See the
    Demo/Custom Theme/CSSLibraries.css for examples.
    If you want to add an extension, such as a new type of button, add a new
    class and add the styles for the button. Then add the class to the button
    in the HTML
    See Buttons/button-plugins.css for examples
    
    MORE INFORMATION & FEEDBACK
    Please visit this web page for more information on how to use the libraries.
    Feedback is actively encouraged
    If you've created any extensions that you think would be helpful in the main library
    files please submit them for consideration
